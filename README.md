# Calculator app

## Description

This is a calculator app created with TypeScript and essentially no external packages, with the exception of Webpack for module bundling and Jest as a testing framework to facilitate test-driven development.

I took heavy design inspiration from Google's calculator and mine aims to be a pared-down version of it.

## Getting started

You can get this calculator up and running by:

- cloning this repo
- installing packages (e.g. `npm i`)
- spinning up a local server (`npm start`)
- `localhost:9000` will then open automatically in your browser

## Tests

This project was made robust through a test-driven development process. There are 58 green tests and counting. You can run them once with `npm test`, or continuously while developing with `npm run test:watch`.
